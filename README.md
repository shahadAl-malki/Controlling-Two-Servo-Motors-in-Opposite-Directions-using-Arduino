# Controlling-Two-Servo-Motors-in-Opposite-Directions-using-Arduino
This project demonstrates how to control two servo motors using an Arduino UNO. The first servo rotates from 0째 to 180째, while the second servo moves in the opposite direction (from 180째 to 0째), creating a smooth mirrored motion using the Servo library.
